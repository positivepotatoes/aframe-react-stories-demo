##Usage
### Installing System Dependencies
```bash
brew install yarn
```
Yarn is a replacement for npm. It's faster and *guarantees* consistency -- as you deploy your code in various environments, you won't run the risk of slight variations in what gets installed.

### Install Project Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the project
```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```
